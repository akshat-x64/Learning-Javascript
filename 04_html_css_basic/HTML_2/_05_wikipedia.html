     <p>The movie begins with Yuta Okkotsu being bullied, only for the bullies to be severely killed by Rika, an overprotective cursed spirit that clings to him. The Jujutsu Society wishes to have the boy executed, as the curse he is host to is a dangerous special-grade spirit. Powerful sorcerer and teacher Satoru Gojo convinces them to let Yuta join Tokyo Jujutsu Technical High instead. Yuta explains to Gojo that Rika was his childhood friend whom he'd promised to marry when they grew up. He had willingly turned himself in, wanting to die, so Rika wouldn't hurt anyone else. Gojo convinces him to choose life and join Jujutsu High to learn to break the curse. Yuta meets fellow students Maki Zenin, Toge Inumaki, and Panda, all with distinct abilities of their own.

        During his first mission with Maki, Yuta is able to purposely summon Rika to save them from a cursed spirit. Afterward, he confides in Gojo that he thinks he may have been the one to curse Rika rather than Rika cursing him because of his love for her. It is revealed that Rika died in a street accident in front of little Yuta, after which she became a curse. Three months pass in his training and Yuta grows close with Maki, Inumaki and Panda. One day, on a mission with Inumaki, the boys are unexpectedly attacked by a high-level curse. Gojo realizes that the man behind the attack was Suguru Geto, a previous student of the school, banished after killing over a hundred innocent people.
        
        Geto declares war on the sorcerers: he will release a thousand curses on the city to kill non-sorcerer humans as he sees them useless. Geto's real reason for the war, however, is to distract Gojo so he can kill Yuta and absorb Rika. Gojo realizes Geto's true goal and transports Inumaki and Panda back to the school to protect Yuta, who is with Maki, not taking part in the battle as newbies. Geto quickly beats Maki, Inumaki and Panda. Pushed to his last resort and wanting to protect his friends, Yuta promises himself as a sacrifice to Rika if she helps him defeat Geto with her full power. Rika fatally wounds Geto as the war is won by the sorcerers. Gojo comes across a dying Geto and it is revealed that the two had been best friends before Geto's ideology drove them apart. Gojo thanks Geto for intentionally sparing the students.
        
        Rika transforms back into her human form. Gojo explains to a surprised Yuta that his theory was correct: he was the one who cursed her, unable to accept her death and forcing her to remain by his side. After he promised his soul to her though, he broke the pact, setting her free. Yuta is actually a descendant of one of the strongest sorcerers in history, explaining his powerful abilities. Gojo is a descendant of the same sorcerer, making the two distant relatives. Rika bids Yuta a warm goodbye and he continues on as a sorcerer-in-training with his friends, still wearing her engagement ring.
        
        In a post-credits scene, Geto's former ally Miguel eats lunch with Yuta in Miguel's native country Kenya. Gojo comes to join them.</p>
